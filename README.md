## Problem Statement and Solution

####I have a friend who is a writer and has books published through Amazon. Last year I created a static HTML / CSS website for her. She wanted a blog but at the time did not want a complete blog engine. She asked for a page where she could just copy and paste into a certain part of the HTML when she wanted to change out a blog entry. She just wanted one post at a time to show. She recently contacted me about setting up a full blog engine. 

####I will be creating three main pages for her. The first will be a page where she can enter a blog. I will consit of a form with three fields for the date, title of the post, and the blog entry. When she saves from this page it will save to a database. She will need this page to be secured and only accessible with password. Another page with be a page where she can delete posts or hide posts. This will be a list of her entrites a check box to hide the post from the public or a button to delete the post from the database. The third page will be the publicly viewable page which will show her blog posts after pulling them from the database. 

####Commenting will be available for blog posts. She wants to be able to approve the comments before they are posted to prevent spam and other undesired content from apearing on her site.
